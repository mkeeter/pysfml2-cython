Welcome to pySFML 2 - Cython's documentation!
=============================================

A new Python 2/3 binding for SFML 2, made with `Cython
<http://cython.org>`_. Most features of SFML are currently available,
but this is still a work in progress. Feel free to report any issue
you encounter.

You can find the source code, downloads and the issue tracker here:
https://github.com/bastienleonard/pysfml2-cython.

There is also a thread on the official forums:
http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5311.0. I use it to make
announcements and answer questions, but if you want to report an
issue, please consider using the Github tracker. I sometimes forget
bugs and suggestions that I read on the forums.

Currently, some classes' members are still undocumented in the
graphics section. If you need more detailed information about them,
please see the `SFML 2 documentation
<http://sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.0/annotated>`_.

If you haved used SFML in the past, you will probably want to read
:ref:`cpptut`.

.. note::

   Make sure you read the :ref:`caveats` page, so that you know what
   the most important current limitations are.
